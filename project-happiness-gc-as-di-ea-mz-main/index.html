    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    
    <p>The World Happiness Report annually ranks over 150 countries. This project aims to visualize happiness scores based on several factors. 
      The relationship between features that affect happiness will be identified and explored through statistical analysis to determine the correlation 
      between the various features and happiness score. This will be displayed in a dashboard format depicting the map of the world and will have the ability 
      to toggle the factors measuring quality of life and the happiness index upon zooming into different countries or regions.</p>

    
    <h1>Visualization</h1>
    
    <p>Include the interactive visualization as part of this page. Static example follows.</p>


<div class = 'content-column'>

    <h2>World Happiness Map</h2>
    <p>The first visualization shows the descriptive statistics of the Happiness Scores for the selected year. By visualizing these statistics, users can compare a nation's performance to the global average, minimum, or maximum. </p>

  <p>The second visualization is a map of all the countries in the World Happienss Report with their Happiness Scores represented by different shades of red. Hover over a country to display their happiness score and other attributes, use the slider to toggle between years. Double click on a country to zoom in or use trackpad to manually zoom in or out. The descriptive statistics below will also update based on the selected year.</p>
    </div>

      <h1>Scatterplot Matrix</h1>
    <p> The third visualization is a matrix of scatterplots that represents the attributes used in calculating a countryâ€™s happiness score, such as the healthy life expectancy, or corruption index, plotted against each other as well as the score itself, colored based on the region of the country. Try brushing over any datapoint to select all corresponding points. The titles located on a designated graph in each row corresponds to each of the graphs in that given row and given column. The significance of this matrix is to show how different factors correlate with each other and which factors have the strongest correlations with higher Happiness Scores. By highlighting countries in the same region, users can also see how specific regions perform across all factors. </p>

    <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>
    
    <p>The main view displays the happiness index for each country in the world based on the scale of the color map used. 
      One quantitative feature can be shown on the map at a time. Upon hovering over a country on the map, the user will be presented with pop-up information about
      the country that is not intended to be displayed in a visual format, including the numeric value of the happiness score of that specific country. </p>
    <p>Additionally, upon scrolling down from the world map view, a scatterplot matrix displays the relationships between happiness index and other quantitative 
      attributes, such as the life expectancy or perceived corruption score, grouped visually by color into different geographical regions. 
      The regional distinction also allows for an easier view of emerging patterns, especially with the available brushing and linking to highlight specific regions.
    </p>
