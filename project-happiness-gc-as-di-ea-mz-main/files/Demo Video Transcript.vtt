00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.500
contributing factors.

00:00:6.210 --> 00:00:14.200
The first visualization is an interactive world map. The darker a country is, the higher its score on the world happiness index.

4
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:21.400
You can hover over any country to see its name, happiness index score, and other metrics.

5
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.120
And Double Click to zoom in closer on the country,

6
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.310
or zoom in and out manually.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.870
You can also use the slider on the top left to view either 2018, 2019, or 2020.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.800
The minimum, maximum, and average scores for the corresponding year appear above the map.

9
00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:02.170
Below the world map is a scatter plot matrix comparing the other factors with the happiness index and each other. Each data point corresponds to a country and is colored based on which region that country is a part of.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:15.000
Divya Iyer: By brushing over any data points the corresponding points in every other scatter plot will highlight.
